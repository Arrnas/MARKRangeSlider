GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs in **MARKRangeSlider** and discussing features, bugs and general feedback. Be sure to check our [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/MARKRangeSlider), [FAQ](https://github.com/markvaldy/MARKRangeSlider/wiki/FAQ) and [past issues](https://github.com/markvaldy/MARKRangeSlider/issues?state=closed) before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash in your application, a stack trace is helpful, but additional context, in the form of code and explanation, is necessary to be of any use.
